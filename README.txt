A WordPress plugin to install and activate a bundle of selected plugins, using TGM-Plugin-Activation.

== Description ==

This is a WordPress plugin to install and activate a bundle of selected plugins, using TGM-Plugin-Activation and roughly based on https://github.com/iPublicis/plugin-bundle-activation by Lopo Lencastre de Almeida.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `workpress-contraption-plugin-bundle.zip` file through the ‘Plugins’ menu in WordPress (or upload `workpress-contraption-plugin-bundle` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory using FTP)
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Choose what plugins you want to activate

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is it safe to delete this plugin after activating the plugins I want? =

Yes.

= Can I have my own plugins’ list? =

Yes. You just have to fork the plugin and edit the `workpress-contraption-plugin-bundle.php` file tho reference the plugins you want installed.

= How come there’s an `Images` folder? =

Useless. It was just research.

== Screenshots ==

No screenshots yet.

1. This screen shot description corresponds to screenshot-1.(png|jpg|jpeg|gif). Note that the screenshot is taken from
the /assets directory or the directory that contains the stable readme.txt (tags or trunk). Screenshots in the /assets
directory take precedence. For example, `/assets/screenshot-1.png` would win over `/tags/4.3/screenshot-1.png`
(or jpg, jpeg, gif).

Not really an upgrade.

== Arbitrary section ==

I’ll do that later…

You may provide arbitrary sections, in the same format as the ones above.  This may be of use for extremely complicated
plugins where more information needs to be conveyed that doesn't fit into the categories of "description" or
"installation."  Arbitrary sections will be shown below the built-in sections outlined above.

== A brief Markdown Example ==

Ordered list:

1. Some feature
1. Another feature
1. Something else about the plugin

Unordered list:

* something
* something else
* third thing

Titles are optional, naturally.

            "Markdown is what the parser uses to process much of the readme file"

Markdown uses email style notation for blockquotes and I've been told:
> Asterisks for *emphasis*. Double it up  for **strong**.

`<?php code(); // goes in backticks ?>`
